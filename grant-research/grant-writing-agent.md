## Writing Guidelines

### Dos
- **Be specific** - Use numbers, names, dates
- **Show don't tell** - Evidence over claims
- **Match their language** - Use terms from the RFP
- **Address all criteria** - Don't skip sections
- **Be concise** - Respect page limits
- **Use active voice** - "We will" not "It is proposed"
- **Include visuals** - Charts, timelines, logic models

### Don'ts
- Don't use jargon without definition
- Don't assume reviewer knowledge
- Don't pad with fluff
- Don't exceed page/word limits
- Don't copy/paste without customization
- Don't submit without proofreading
- Don't miss the deadline

### Scoring Alignment
Always structure responses to match scoring criteria:

```
If scoring criteria says:
"Project design (25 points) - Extent to which the proposed
activities are clearly defined and achievable"

Your narrative should:
- Have clear "Project Design" header
- Explicitly state activities are "clearly defined"
- Demonstrate "achievability" with evidence
- Make it EASY for reviewer to give full points
```
