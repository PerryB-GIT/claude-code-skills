# Sales Discovery - Qualification & Discovery Calls

## Discovery Philosophy
```
Discovery is not about qualifying the prospect IN.
It's about understanding deeply enough to either:
1. Help them solve their problem (sell)
2. Disqualify them (save everyone's time)

BAD discovery: "Do you have budget?"
GOOD discovery: "Help me understand how you evaluate investments like this."
```

Challenges: What's getting in the way?
Timeline: When do you need this done?

## Active Listening Techniques

### The 70/30 Rule
```
You talk: 30% (or less)
They talk: 70% (or more)

HOW TO ACHIEVE:
- Ask open-ended questions
- Use silence (count to 3 before speaking)
- Summarize instead of adding
- "Tell me more about that"
```

### Mirroring
```
Repeat the last 3 words they said (as a question).

Them: "We're really struggling with reporting."
You: "Struggling with reporting?"
Them: "Yeah, it takes hours to pull data..."

WHY IT WORKS:
- Shows you're listening
- Gets them to elaborate
- Reveals deeper issues
```

### Labeling
```
Name the emotion or dynamic you observe.

"It sounds like you're frustrated with..."
"It seems like this is causing pressure..."
"I'm sensing some hesitation about..."

WHY IT WORKS:
- Validates their feelings
- Builds rapport
- Opens them up
```

### Summarizing
```
Periodically recap what you've heard.

"Let me make sure I understand:
- You're dealing with [problem 1]
- Which is causing [impact]
- And you need to solve this by [timeline]
- With [stakeholders] involved

Did I get that right?"

WHY IT WORKS:
- Confirms understanding
- Shows you listened
- Lets them correct/add
```
