# Sales Closing - Negotiation & Closing Deals

## Closing Philosophy
```
Closing is not manipulation - it's helping qualified
prospects make decisions that are good for them.

If you've done discovery right and they're qualified,
closing is the natural next step.

"Always Be Closing" → "Always Be Helping"
```

---

## The Closing Mindset

### Why Deals Stall
```
1. Unclear value (haven't made the business case)
2. No urgency (no reason to act now)
3. Wrong stakeholders (decision maker not engaged)
4. Unaddressed objections (concerns not surfaced)
5. Risk too high (fear of making wrong choice)
6. Process unclear (don't know how to move forward)
7. Champion not empowered (can't sell internally)
```

### Signs a Deal Will Close
```
GREEN FLAGS:
✓ Pain is quantified and urgent
✓ Economic buyer is engaged
✓ Champion is selling internally
✓ They're asking "how" questions (not "if")
✓ Timeline is defined and real
✓ Budget is confirmed
✓ They're involving implementation people
✓ Asking about contract terms
✓ Checking references
✓ Discussing rollout/onboarding
```

## Closing Techniques

### Trial Close (Temperature Check)
```
Use throughout the sales process to gauge readiness.

QUESTIONS:
"How are you feeling about what you've seen so far?"
"On a scale of 1-10, where are you on this?"
"What would need to be true for this to be a yes?"
"Do you see this solving your [problem]?"
"Is there anything holding you back?"

PURPOSE:
- Surface objections early
- Gauge commitment level
- Identify gaps to address
```

### Assumptive Close
```
Assume the sale and discuss next steps.

"Great - let me send over the agreement. Would you
prefer to start on the 1st or the 15th?"

"I'll get the contract to you today. Should I cc
[their champion] or send it directly to you?"

"Let's get implementation scheduled. Who should I
work with on your side to coordinate?"

WHEN TO USE:
- Strong buying signals
- All objections addressed
- Clear decision authority
```

### Summary Close
```
Recap the value and ask for commitment.

"Let me make sure I have this right:
- You need [outcome 1] - we solve that with [feature]
- You need [outcome 2] - we handle that with [feature]
- You need it live by [date] - we can do [timeline]
- The investment is [price] with [ROI]

Does that capture everything?

If so, what do you need from me to move forward?"

WHEN TO USE:
- Complex deals with multiple requirements
- Multiple stakeholders to align
- Before sending proposal
```

### Urgency Close (Use Ethically)
```
LEGITIMATE URGENCY:
- "Our pricing increases next quarter"
- "Implementation slots are filling up for Q1"
- "Current promotion ends [specific date]"
- "Your timeline requires starting by [date]"

CREATING URGENCY (Based on their situation):
- "You mentioned needing this live by [date].
  Working backwards, we'd need to start by [date]."
- "Every week this isn't solved costs you [quantified pain]."
- "Your competitor just signed with us - timing matters."

NEVER:
- Fake scarcity
- Made-up deadlines
- Pressure tactics
- Fear mongering
```

### Alternative Close
```
Give two options, both of which are a "yes."

"Would you prefer the annual plan with the discount,
or monthly for more flexibility?"

"Should we start with the pilot program, or go ahead
with full implementation?"

"Do you want to include training now, or add it after
you're up and running?"

WHEN TO USE:
- Prospect is interested but indecisive
- Two legitimate options exist
- Simplifying a complex decision
```

### The "What Would It Take" Close
```
"What would it take to make this a yes?"

Then LISTEN.

They'll tell you exactly what they need.
Either deliver it or know you can't close this deal.
```

---

## Objection Handling Framework

### LAER Method
```
L - LISTEN
    Don't interrupt. Let them finish completely.
    Take notes. Show you're paying attention.

A - ACKNOWLEDGE
    Validate their concern. Don't dismiss it.
    "I understand why you'd feel that way."
    "That's a fair concern."
    "Thanks for being direct about that."

E - EXPLORE
    Dig deeper. Understand the root cause.
    "Help me understand more about that."
    "What specifically concerns you?"
    "Is it the [price/timing/fit] or something else?"

R - RESPOND
    Address the specific concern with facts/proof.
    Only respond once you understand the real issue.
```

### Common Objections & Responses

**"It's too expensive"**
```
EXPLORE:
"I appreciate you being direct. Help me understand -
is it that the total investment is too high, or that
the timing of the spend is challenging?"

IF TOTAL TOO HIGH:
"Let's talk about ROI. You mentioned [problem] is
costing you [amount]. Our solution would [solve
that], meaning you'd see [return]. Does that math
work for your business?"

IF TIMING:
"What if we structured the payment differently?
We could do [quarterly/phased/delayed start]."

IF JUST NEGOTIATING:
"I understand you want the best deal. What I can
do is [specific concession] if we can [get something
in return - faster close, longer term, case study]."
```

**"We're happy with our current solution"**
```
ACKNOWLEDGE:
"That's good to hear - you've clearly invested time
in your current setup."

EXPLORE:
"What's working well? And where do you see gaps?"

RESPOND (Based on what they share):
"Sounds like [current solution] handles [X] well.
Where we typically help companies like yours is with
[gap they mentioned or pain from discovery]. Is that
something worth exploring?"
```

**"I need to talk to my [boss/team/partner]"**
```
ACKNOWLEDGE:
"Of course - important decisions need the right input."

EXPLORE:
"What do you think their main questions will be?"
"What concerns might they have?"
"How have similar decisions been made in the past?"

RESPOND:
"Would it help if I joined that conversation to
answer questions directly?"

OR:
"What can I prepare for you to make that conversation
easier? A summary? ROI calculator? References?"
```

**"We're not ready right now"**
```
EXPLORE:
"I understand. Help me understand - is it bandwidth,
budget, or something else?"

IF BANDWIDTH:
"What would need to change for this to become a priority?"
"Is there a lighter-weight way to get started?"

IF BUDGET:
"When does your budget cycle reset?"
"Is there a way to phase this over two budget periods?"

IF SOMETHING ELSE:
[Address the real issue]

ALWAYS:
"What timeframe makes sense to revisit this?
I'll put a reminder to follow up in [timeframe]."
```

**"We're looking at your competitor"**
```
DON'T: Badmouth the competitor
DO: Differentiate on value

"Good - you should evaluate your options. What criteria
are most important in your decision?"

[Listen]

"Based on what you've shared, here's where we're
different: [specific differentiator relevant to them]."

"Would it help to speak with a customer who evaluated
both and chose us? I can connect you with [reference]."
```

**"Send me a proposal and I'll get back to you"**
```
WARNING: Often a polite way to end the conversation.

EXPLORE:
"Happy to do that. Before I do - what would make this
proposal a clear yes vs. a 'we'll think about it'?"

"Who else will be reviewing the proposal?"

"What's your timeline for making a decision?"

"When should I follow up after you've reviewed it?"

IF NO CLEAR ANSWERS:
This deal may not be real. Qualify harder before
investing time in a proposal.
```

## Pricing Negotiations

### Before Negotiating
```
KNOW YOUR NUMBERS:
- List price
- Floor price (can't go below)
- Standard discount authority
- What requires approval

KNOW THEIR SITUATION:
- Budget constraints
- Decision timeline
- Competitive alternatives
- Their leverage
```

### Negotiation Principles
```
1. NEVER negotiate against yourself
   Don't lower price before they ask.

2. GET something for every GIVE
   Discount? Get faster close, longer term, case study.

3. PRICE is not the only lever
   Terms, implementation, support, timeline.

4. SILENCE is powerful
   State your position and wait.

5. KNOW your walk-away point
   Some deals aren't worth winning.
```

### Responding to Discount Requests

**"Can you do better on price?"**
```
FIRST RESPONSE:
"What did you have in mind?"
(Don't negotiate against yourself)

IF THEY GIVE A NUMBER:
"I may be able to work with that. If we could get
there, would you be ready to move forward today?"

IF REASONABLE:
"I can do [adjusted price] if we can [close by date/
sign annual/add scope]."

IF UNREASONABLE:
"I appreciate you being direct. That's below what we
can do. The best I can offer is [floor]. Does that work?"
```

### Creative Negotiation Options
```
INSTEAD OF LOWERING PRICE:

More value for same price:
- Additional users/seats
- Extended implementation support
- Free training
- Longer contract with same rate
- Premium features

Same price, different structure:
- Payment terms (Net 60 vs Net 30)
- Phased implementation
- Quarterly vs annual billing
- Delayed start date

Conditional discount:
- Volume commitment
- Multi-year deal
- Case study participation
- Reference calls
- Testimonial
```

---

## Closing Complex Deals

### Multi-Stakeholder Alignment
```
MAP THE BUYING COMMITTEE:
- Economic Buyer (approves budget)
- Champion (your advocate)
- Technical Evaluator (validates solution)
- End User (uses the product)
- Blocker (potential "no" vote)

FOR EACH:
- What do they care about?
- What's their "win"?
- What objections will they have?
- How do we neutralize blockers?
```

### The Mutual Action Plan (MAP)
```
Shared document outlining steps to close:

## Mutual Action Plan: [Company] + [Your Company]

**Goal**: Go live by [date]

**Key Contacts**
| Name | Role | Responsibility |
|------|------|----------------|
| ... | ... | ... |

**Timeline**
| Date | Milestone | Owner | Status |
|------|-----------|-------|--------|
| Oct 1 | Technical review | [IT] | Done |
| Oct 8 | Security assessment | [Security] | In Progress |
| Oct 15 | Executive briefing | [Sponsor] | Scheduled |
| Oct 22 | Contract review | [Legal] | Not Started |
| Oct 29 | Signature | [CFO] | Not Started |
| Nov 1 | Kickoff | [Both] | Not Started |

**Open Items**
- [ ] Item 1 - Owner - Due date
- [ ] Item 2 - Owner - Due date

SHARE WITH CHAMPION. Update weekly.
```

### Getting to Signature

**When Contract is With Legal**
```
"I know legal reviews can take time. A few questions:
- Who specifically is reviewing?
- What's their typical turnaround?
- What issues usually come up?
- Should I have our legal reach out directly?"

STAY IN TOUCH:
Check in every 2-3 days.
Offer to answer questions.
Don't go silent and hope.
```

**Signature Nudges**
```
"The contract's been with your team for a week -
is there anything holding it up?"

"I want to make sure we hit your [date] deadline.
We'd need signature by [date] to start on time."

"Our implementation team is ready to go. As soon
as we have signature, I can get you on the calendar."

"Is there anything I can do to help move this along?"
```

## When to Walk Away

### Deal Disqualifiers
```
WALK AWAY IF:
- Price demanded is below your floor
- Requirements you can't meet
- Unreasonable contract terms
- Bad faith negotiating
- They're using you for leverage
- Likely to be a bad customer
- Ethical concerns

HOW TO WALK AWAY:
"I appreciate your time in this process. Based on
[reason], I don't think we're the right fit for
you right now. I wish you the best in finding a
solution that works. If anything changes, my door
is always open."
```

### The Walk-Away Close
```
Sometimes walking away brings them back.

"Based on what you've shared, I'm not sure we can
make this work. [Specific reason]. It doesn't make
sense for either of us to force a fit."

[Pause]

If they want the deal, they'll often counter with
a path forward. If not, you've saved yourself a
bad deal.
```
