# Founder-Led Sales - Early Stage Startup Sales

## The Founder Sales Mindset
```
You're not "doing sales" - you're learning what customers want.
Every call is product research disguised as a sales conversation.

GOALS OF FOUNDER SALES:
1. Validate product-market fit
2. Discover repeatable pain points
3. Find messaging that resonates
4. Set pricing that works
5. Build case studies for future sales
```

## Before Your First Sale

### Pre-Sales Checklist
```
□ Can you explain what you do in one sentence?
□ Do you know who has the problem you solve?
□ Can you name 3 companies that should buy?
□ Do you have a way to demo or show value?
□ Have you talked to 20+ potential customers?
□ Do you have a price (even if you'll change it)?
```

### Your One-Liner
```
Template:
"We help [specific audience] [achieve outcome] without [pain point]."

Examples:
"We help SaaS companies reduce churn by predicting at-risk
customers before they cancel."

"We help e-commerce brands increase AOV by personalizing
product recommendations in real-time."

Test: Can someone repeat it after hearing it once?
```

### The "Mom Test" Questions
```
From Rob Fitzpatrick's "The Mom Test":

BAD: "Would you buy this?"
(People lie to be nice)

GOOD: "Tell me about the last time you dealt with [problem]."
(Past behavior doesn't lie)

BAD: "Do you think this is a good idea?"
(Opinions aren't validation)

GOOD: "What have you tried to solve this?"
(Shows actual pain)

BAD: "How much would you pay for this?"
(Hypotheticals are worthless)

GOOD: "What's this problem costing you today?"
(Real data)
```

### Discovery Questions for Founders
```
PROBLEM VALIDATION
- "What's the hardest part of [their job]?"
- "How are you solving this today?"
- "What have you tried that didn't work?"
- "How often does this problem occur?"

PAIN QUANTIFICATION
- "What does this cost you in time/money?"
- "What would solving this be worth?"
- "Who else feels this pain?"

BUYING SIGNALS
- "When do you need this solved by?"
- "What's your budget for tools like this?"
- "Who else would be involved in this decision?"
```

## Pricing Your First Deals

### Pricing Discovery
```
DON'T: Pick a price and hope it works
DO: Test pricing in real conversations

QUESTIONS:
"Based on what I've shown you, what would you
expect something like this to cost?"

"If this saved you [X hours/Y dollars], what
would that be worth to your business?"

"We're still finalizing pricing - would $X/month
feel reasonable for what you've seen?"
```

### Early Stage Pricing Strategy
```
OPTION 1: Start Low, Raise Later
- Get early customers fast
- Validate product
- Raise prices for new customers
- Risk: Sets low anchor

OPTION 2: Start High, Discount Selectively
- Learn true willingness to pay
- Discount for early adopters
- Better long-term pricing
- Risk: Slower to close

RECOMMENDATION FOR FOUNDERS:
Start higher than you think, offer "founding customer"
discounts (20-40%) for early adopters in exchange for:
- Feedback and calls
- Case study rights
- Testimonials
- References
```

### Founding Customer Terms
```
"As a founding customer, you'll get:
- X% discount locked in for [term]
- Direct access to me for feedback
- Input on our roadmap

In exchange, I ask for:
- 30-minute feedback call monthly
- Permission to use you as a reference
- A case study when you see results"
```

## Handling Founder Sales Objections

### "You're too small/new"
```
"You're right - we're early. That's actually an
advantage for you:

1. You get my direct attention - I'm the founder
2. You'll shape the product roadmap
3. Founding customer pricing (before we raise)
4. We're hungry to make you successful

Our early customers get white-glove treatment
that won't exist at scale. Is that interesting?"
```

### "What if you go out of business?"
```
"Fair concern. Here's how I think about it:

1. We have [X months] runway / are profitable
2. Your data is exportable anytime
3. You're on month-to-month (low risk)
4. The value you get in the meantime is real

What specific concern can I address?"
```

### "Can I get a pilot/free trial?"
```
Good response for enterprise:
"Absolutely - we do 30-day pilots. Here's how
it works: I'll need [minimal commitment] from
your side to ensure we set it up right. Fair?"

Good response for SMB:
"We do 14-day free trials with full access.
If it works, you continue. If not, cancel
anytime. Want me to set that up now?"
```

### "I need to think about it"
```
"Totally get it. What specifically do you want
to think through?

[Listen]

What would help you get clarity on that? Happy
to [send more info/do another call/connect you
with a reference]."
```
