## ROI & Performance Analysis

### Return on Investment (ROI) Calculations
```
SIMPLE ROI:
ROI = (Gain - Cost) / Cost × 100

Example:
Bought: $10,000
Sold: $12,500
ROI = ($12,500 - $10,000) / $10,000 × 100 = 25%

ANNUALIZED ROI (CAGR):
CAGR = (Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1/Years) - 1

Example:
Start: $10,000
End: $15,000
Years: 3
CAGR = ($15,000 / $10,000)^(1/3) - 1 = 14.5%

TOTAL RETURN:
Total Return = Capital Gains + Dividends + Interest
Include all income sources for true return
```

### Investment Performance Metrics
```
SHARPE RATIO:
Measures risk-adjusted return
Sharpe = (Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Standard Deviation
Higher is better (>1 is good, >2 is excellent)

ALPHA:
Excess return vs benchmark
Positive alpha = beating the market
Example: Market +10%, You +12% = Alpha +2%

BETA:
Volatility vs market
Beta 1.0 = moves with market
Beta 1.5 = 50% more volatile
Beta 0.5 = 50% less volatile

STANDARD DEVIATION:
Measures volatility
Higher = more volatile/risky
Lower = more stable
```

- Net taxable gain: $3,000

RULES:
- Wash sale rule: Can't buy "substantially identical" security within 30 days
- Can offset unlimited gains
- Can deduct $3,000/year against income
- Carry forward unused losses

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Sell losing position
2. Wait 31 days OR
3. Buy similar (not identical) fund immediately
   - Example: Sell VTI, buy ITOT
```

## Wealth Building Strategies

### Compound Interest Calculator
```
FUTURE VALUE:
FV = PV × (1 + r)^n

Where:
FV = Future Value
PV = Present Value (starting amount)
r = Annual return rate
n = Number of years

EXAMPLE:
$10,000 invested at 8% for 30 years:
FV = $10,000 × (1.08)^30 = $100,627

WITH MONTHLY CONTRIBUTIONS:
$500/month at 8% for 30 years:
Total contributions: $180,000
Ending value: ~$745,000
```

### Wealth Milestones
```
THE WEALTH PYRAMID:

Level 1: Emergency Fund
- 3-6 months expenses in cash
- High-yield savings account
- Foundation for everything

Level 2: Debt Freedom
- Pay off high-interest debt
- Keep mortgage if rate is low
- Free up cash flow

Level 3: Investment Foundation
- Max retirement accounts
- Build taxable investments
- Consistent contributions

Level 4: Financial Independence
- 25x annual expenses saved
- 4% withdrawal rate
- Work becomes optional

Level 5: Generational Wealth
- Multi-generational planning
- Trust/estate structures
- Legacy giving
```

### FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early)
```
FIRE BASICS:
Save 50-70% of income
Build 25x annual expenses
Withdraw 4% per year (safe withdrawal rate)

EXAMPLE:
Annual expenses: $40,000
FIRE number: $40,000 × 25 = $1,000,000
Safe withdrawal: $1,000,000 × 4% = $40,000/year

FIRE VARIATIONS:
- Lean FIRE: Minimal expenses (<$40K/year)
- Fat FIRE: Higher lifestyle (>$100K/year)
- Barista FIRE: Part-time work + investments
- Coast FIRE: Enough invested to retire later without more savings
