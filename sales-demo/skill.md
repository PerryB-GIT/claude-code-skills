# Sales Demo - Product Demonstrations & Presentations

## Demo Philosophy
```
A demo is not a product tour.
A demo is showing how YOUR product solves THEIR specific problem.

BAD: "Let me show you all our features."
GOOD: "Based on what you shared about X, let me show you how we solve that."
```

## Demo Structure

### The Tell-Show-Tell Framework
```
TELL: "One thing I heard was [pain point]..."
SHOW: [Demonstrate the feature/solution]
TELL: "So what this means for you is [benefit]..."

EXAMPLE:
TELL: "You mentioned your team spends hours manually
      pulling reports each week."

SHOW: [Navigate to reports, click 'Generate',
      show instant results]

TELL: "So instead of hours, you're looking at seconds.
      That's time your team gets back for [their priority]."
```

### Opening the Demo
```
"Thanks everyone for joining. Before I jump into
the demo, let me quickly recap what I learned from
[Champion] to make sure I focus on what matters most.

[Champion] shared that:
- [Pain point 1] is costing you [impact]
- [Pain point 2] is a priority because [reason]
- You need to have this solved by [timeline]

Is there anything I should add or adjust?

Great. With that in mind, I'm going to focus today's
demo on three areas:
1. [Solving pain 1]
2. [Addressing pain 2]
3. [Key differentiator]

Sound good? Let's dive in."
```

## During the Demo

### Demo Best Practices
```
DO:
✓ Start with their #1 pain
✓ Pause frequently for questions
✓ Use their language and terminology
✓ Show, don't just tell
✓ Connect every feature to their problem
✓ Tell stories of similar customers
✓ Watch for reactions (video if possible)
✓ Take notes on questions/concerns

DON'T:
✗ Show every feature
✗ Read from the screen
✗ Rush through sections
✗ Ignore questions to "stay on track"
✗ Use jargon they don't know
✗ Demo features they don't need
✗ Talk more than you show
✗ Let one person dominate
```

### Engaging Multiple Stakeholders
```
CALL ON PEOPLE BY NAME:
"[Name], I know security is top priority for you -
let me show you how we handle that."

CHECK IN REGULARLY:
"[Name], does that address what you were concerned about?"

READ THE ROOM:
- Nodding = keep going
- Confused look = pause and clarify
- Typing/distracted = you've lost them
- Questions = good sign, engage

BALANCE ATTENTION:
- Don't just demo to the champion
- Give each stakeholder their moment
- Address technical questions to technical people
```

### Handling Demo Questions

**"Can you show us [feature not in plan]?"**
```
If relevant:
"Absolutely - let me pull that up."
[Show briefly, then return to flow]

If not relevant:
"I can definitely show that. For today, I want
to make sure we cover [their priorities] first.
Would it be okay to circle back to [feature]
if we have time, or save it for a follow-up?"
```

**"How does this compare to [competitor]?"**
```
"Great question. The main differences are:
[1-2 key differentiators related to their needs]

But honestly, the best comparison is whether we
solve YOUR problem. Based on what you've shared,
here's how we address that..."

[Redirect to demo]
```

**"We tried something similar and it didn't work"**
```
"I appreciate you sharing that. What specifically
didn't work?

[Listen]

That makes sense. Here's how we're different..."
[Show specific proof]
```

## Storytelling in Demos

process] and it was causing [pain]."

SOLUTION: "We helped them implement [your product],
specifically [relevant features]."

RESULT: "Within [timeframe], they saw [specific outcome].
[Quote from customer if available]"

BRIDGE: "Based on what you've shared, I think you could
see similar results because [connection to their situation]."
```

### When to Use Stories
```
USE STORIES WHEN:
- They're skeptical (social proof)
- Feature is hard to visualize
- You need to build credibility
- Explaining complex value
- Overcoming objections

KEEP STORIES:
- Short (60-90 seconds)
- Relevant (similar company/problem)
- Specific (real numbers, real outcomes)
- Recent (within last 1-2 years)
```

## Demo Troubleshooting

### When Things Go Wrong

**Internet/Tech Fails**
```
"Looks like we're having some technical difficulties.
Let me try [backup plan]. While I do that, [Champion],
maybe you can share what you've seen so far?"

BACKUP OPTIONS:
- Switch to mobile hotspot
- Share recorded video
- Use screenshots
- Describe and follow up with recording
- Reschedule with apology
```

**Lost the Room**
```
SIGNS:
- Checking phones/email
- Side conversations
- Glazed expressions
- Short, unengaged answers

RECOVERY:
"I want to make sure I'm focusing on what matters most.
[Name], is there something specific you'd like me to
show that would be more relevant?"

OR:
"Let me pause here. We've covered a lot.
What questions do you have so far?"
```

**Hostile Audience Member**
```
DON'T:
- Get defensive
- Argue
- Ignore them

DO:
- Acknowledge their concern
- Ask clarifying questions
- Be honest about limitations
- Offer to address offline if needed

"I hear that concern. Can you help me understand
more about what's driving that? I want to make sure
I address it properly."
```

## Demo Mistakes to Avoid

### The 10 Deadly Demo Sins
```
1. No discovery recap
   "They already know why they're here"
   (They don't - and new people joined)

2. Feature vomit
   "Let me show you everything"
   (Show only what matters to THEM)

3. Reading the screen
   "As you can see here..."
   (They can see - add value)

4. Ignoring reactions
   "Let me just finish this section"
   (Pay attention - adapt)

5. One-size-fits-all
   Same demo for every prospect
   (Customize or lose)

6. No stories
   Just features, no outcomes
   (Features don't close deals)

7. No pauses
   Talking non-stop for 30 minutes
   (Pause. Ask questions. Breathe.)

8. Unclear next step
   "Let us know what you think"
   (Propose a specific action)

9. Demo to wrong person
   IT person gets business demo
   (Know your audience)

10. No backup plan
    Tech fails, demo dies
    (Always have plan B)
```
