## Algorithm Understanding

### How TikTok Distributes Content
1. Shows to small test group (~200-500)
2. Measures: Watch time, completion, shares, comments, likes
3. If metrics good → larger audience
4. Repeat until metrics drop
5. Video can go viral days/weeks later

### Key Metrics (in order of importance)
1. **Watch time/Completion rate** - Most important
2. **Rewatches** - People watching again
3. **Shares** - Sending to friends
4. **Comments** - Engagement
5. **Likes** - Lowest priority

### Optimize for Watch Time
- Strong hook in first second
- Visual changes every 2-3 seconds
- Text overlays for engagement
- Surprise or payoff at end
- Loop potential (end connects to start)

## Trending Sounds & Effects
