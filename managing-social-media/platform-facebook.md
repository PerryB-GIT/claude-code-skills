### What Works on Facebook

**High Performers**:

- Questions that spark discussion
- Local/community content
- Behind-the-scenes
- User-generated content
- Timely/news content
- Contests and giveaways

**Lower Performers**:
- External links (algorithm deprioritizes)
- Overly promotional posts
- Low-quality images
- Text-only posts without hook
- Engagement bait ("Like if you agree!")

### Content Mix

**Ideal Distribution**:
- 40% Video content (Reels, Lives, native video)
- 25% Engaging posts (questions, polls, discussions)
- 20% Visual content (photos, graphics)
- 15% Links and promotions

### Post Formats

**Video (Best reach)**
- Native upload always
- 1-3 minutes optimal
- Captions required (85% watch muted)
- Square or vertical format
- Hook in first 3 seconds

**Facebook Reels**
- Vertical video (9:16)
- 15-90 seconds
- Trending audio helps
- Similar strategy to Instagram Reels

**Live Video (Highest engagement)**
- Notifies followers
- Algorithm boost during and after
- Q&A, behind scenes, events
- 10-60 minutes optimal

**Photos**
- High quality, bright
- 1200x630px (landscape) or 1080x1080 (square)
- Faces perform well
- Minimal text overlay

**Carousels**
- Multiple images in one post
- Great for showcasing products
- Tell a story across slides

**Text Posts**
- Questions drive comments
- Keep under 80 characters for best engagement
- Use line breaks
- Add emoji sparingly

**Links**
- Put link in comments (not post) for better reach
- Or use link posts when traffic is priority
- Custom thumbnails when possible
