```

```

### Cold Call Framework (OPENER)

E - Empathy/relevance to them
N - Need identification question
E - Earn the meeting
R - Request specific time

EXAMPLE:
"Hi [Name], this is [You] from [Company].

The reason for my call - I noticed [Company] just
[trigger event]. When that happens, [pain point]
usually becomes a priority.

Is that something you're dealing with right now?

[If yes] I'd love 15 minutes to show you how we
helped [similar company] solve this. Do you have
your calendar handy?"
```

---

## Qualification Frameworks

### BANT (Traditional)
```
B - Budget: Do they have money?
A - Authority: Can they decide?
N - Need: Is there real pain?
T - Timeline: When would they buy?

QUESTIONS:
Budget: "Is there budget allocated for this?"
Authority: "Who else would be involved in this decision?"
Need: "What happens if you don't solve this?"
Timeline: "When are you looking to have this in place?"
```

### MEDDIC (Enterprise)
```
M - Metrics: What are they measuring?
E - Economic Buyer: Who controls budget?
D - Decision Criteria: How will they choose?
D - Decision Process: What are the steps?
I - Identify Pain: What's the real problem?
C - Champion: Who's your internal advocate?

QUESTIONS:
Metrics: "How do you measure success here?"
Economic Buyer: "Who signs off on purchases like this?"
Decision Criteria: "What factors matter most in your decision?"
Decision Process: "Walk me through how you've made similar decisions."
Pain: "What's the cost of not solving this?"
Champion: "Who on your team feels this pain most acutely?"
```

### SPICED (Modern)
```
S - Situation: Current state
P - Pain: Problems and challenges
I - Impact: Business consequences
C - Critical Event: Why now?
E - Decision: How they'll choose
D - Decision Maker: Who decides

Best for: Complex, multi-stakeholder deals
```

## Discovery Call Structure

### The 30-Minute Discovery Call
```
0:00-2:00  - Rapport + agenda setting
2:00-5:00  - Their situation/context
5:00-15:00 - Pain deep-dive (SPIN)
15:00-20:00 - Impact quantification
20:00-25:00 - Decision process/timeline
25:00-28:00 - Quick capability overview
28:00-30:00 - Next steps + commitment

KEY: Ask 70%, Talk 30%
```

### SPIN Selling Questions
```
SITUATION (Context)
- "Tell me about your current process for..."
- "How long have you been doing it this way?"
- "How many people are involved?"

PROBLEM (Surface issues)
- "What challenges are you facing with...?"
- "Where does the process break down?"
- "What's most frustrating about...?"

IMPLICATION (Consequences)
- "What happens when that occurs?"
- "How does that affect [revenue/team/customers]?"
- "What's the cost of that problem?"

NEED-PAYOFF (Solution value)
- "How would it help if you could...?"
- "What would solving this mean for you?"
- "If this was fixed, what would change?"
```

---

## Demo Best Practices

### Demo Structure (USE: /sales-demo for full details)
```
1. RESET (2 min)
   - Confirm what you learned in discovery
   - "Last time you mentioned X was the priority..."

2. AGENDA (1 min)
   - What you'll cover
   - Time check

3. SHOW (15-20 min)
   - Lead with their #1 pain point
   - Tell > Show > Tell
   - 3 features max
   - Pause for questions

4. SUMMARIZE (2 min)
   - Recap value tied to their pain
   - "Based on what you shared about X..."

5. NEXT STEPS (5 min)
   - Specific action with date
   - Multi-thread (involve others)
```

### Demo Mistakes to Avoid
```
- Feature dumping (showing everything)
- No discovery recap
- Talking more than showing
- Ignoring questions to "get through slides"
- No clear next step
- Demoing to wrong persona
```

---

## Objection Handling

### The LAER Framework
```
L - Listen (don't interrupt)
A - Acknowledge (validate concern)
E - Explore (understand root cause)
R - Respond (address specifically)

EXAMPLE:
Objection: "It's too expensive"

Listen: [Let them finish]
Acknowledge: "I hear you - budget is always a concern."
Explore: "Help me understand - is it the total cost, or
         the timing of the spend?"
Respond: [Based on their answer]
```

### Common Objections + Responses

**"We're happy with our current solution"**
```
"That's great to hear - what specifically is working well?

[Listen]

Makes sense. What I hear from companies like yours is
that [current solution] works fine for [basic use case],
but when [scaling/specific scenario], that's where gaps
appear. Is that something you've experienced?"
```

**"We don't have budget"**
```
"I appreciate you being upfront about that.

Quick question - is it that there's no budget for
anything new, or that this hasn't been prioritized yet?

[If not prioritized]
What would need to change for this to become a priority?
```

**"I need to think about it"**
```
"Totally understand - this is a big decision.

What specifically do you want to think through?
Is it [price/fit/timing/stakeholders]?

[After they answer]
That makes sense. What would help you get clarity on that?
```

**"Your competitor is cheaper"**
```
"They might be - we're not trying to be the cheapest.

What I'm curious about - when you look at [competitor],
what's driving that comparison? Is it features,
or purely price?

[If features] We should talk about [key differentiator]
[If price] What's the cost of [problem] staying unsolved?
```

**"We're not ready right now"**
```
"Fair enough. When you say 'not ready' - is that
bandwidth, budget, or something else?

[Listen]

Got it. When would be a better time to revisit this?
I can set a reminder to follow up [timeframe].
```

## Pricing Conversations

### Presenting Price
```
1. Summarize value first
   "Based on what you've shared, [solution] would
   help you [outcome 1], [outcome 2], and [outcome 3]."

2. Anchor high (if ranges)
   "Companies your size typically invest between
   $50K and $80K annually."

3. Present price confidently
   "The investment for [package] is $65,000/year."

4. Shut up
   Let them respond. Don't justify immediately.

5. Handle response
   [See objection handling]
```

### Discounting Guidelines
```
NEVER discount without getting something:
- Faster close (sign by Friday)
- Longer term (annual vs monthly)
- Case study participation
- Reference calls
- Larger scope (more seats/features)
- Prepayment

TYPICAL MAX DISCOUNT: 10-20%
Exception: Strategic accounts (board approval)
```

---

## Closing Techniques

### Trial Close (Temperature Check)
```
"Based on what we've discussed, how are you feeling
about moving forward?"

"On a scale of 1-10, where are you on this?"

"What would need to be true for this to be a yes?"
```

### Assumptive Close
```
"Great - let me send over the agreement. Would you
prefer to start on the 1st or the 15th?"

"I'll get the contract to you today. Who should I
cc on the email?"
```

### Summary Close
```
"Let me make sure I have this right:
- You need [outcome 1] - we do that with [feature]
- You need [outcome 2] - we handle that with [feature]
- You need it by [date] - we can have you live in [time]

Does that capture everything?

If so, let's get the paperwork started."
```

### Urgency Close (Use Sparingly)
```
Legitimate urgency only:
- "Pricing increases next month"
- "Implementation slots are filling up"
- "Current promotion ends [date]"

NOT: Fake scarcity or pressure tactics
```

## Pipeline Management

### Pipeline Hygiene Rules
```
1. Update CRM after every interaction
2. Move deals forward or out (no stagnation)
3. Every deal needs a next step with date
4. Review pipeline weekly
5. If no activity in 14 days, qualify out
```

### Pipeline Coverage
```
RULE: 3-4x pipeline coverage

Need $100K in revenue?
→ Need $300-400K in pipeline

WHY: ~25-30% of pipeline closes
```

### Deal Velocity Metrics
```
Track weekly:
- Deals created
- Deals moved forward
- Deals closed (won/lost)
- Average deal size
- Average sales cycle
- Win rate by stage
```
