# Sales Ops - Pipeline Management & Sales Operations

## Sales Ops Philosophy
```
Sales Ops exists to make sellers more productive.

If a process doesn't help close more deals faster,
question whether it needs to exist.

"Sales Ops is the grease, not the engine."
```

## Pipeline Management

### Pipeline Stages (Standard)
```
STAGE        | PROBABILITY | CRITERIA TO ENTER
-------------|-------------|-------------------
Prospecting  | 0%          | Identified, not contacted
Qualified    | 10%         | First meeting, BANT confirmed
Discovery    | 20%         | Pain understood, stakeholders ID'd
Demo         | 40%         | Solution presented
Proposal     | 60%         | Pricing delivered
Negotiation  | 80%         | Terms being discussed
Closed Won   | 100%        | Contract signed
Closed Lost  | 0%          | Deal dead

Note: Customize probabilities based on your actual conversion rates.
```

### Pipeline Hygiene Rules
```
WEEKLY MUST-DOS:
□ Update every active deal
□ Add next step + date to each
□ Move stalled deals out (14+ days no activity)
□ Review deals with close date this month
□ Update close dates if they've slipped
□ Remove dead deals from pipeline

RED FLAGS:
⚠️ No next step scheduled
⚠️ Past due close date
⚠️ No activity in 14+ days
⚠️ Single-threaded (only one contact)
⚠️ Missing key qualification data
⚠️ No champion identified
```

### Pipeline Coverage Formula
```
RULE: 3-4x coverage for quota attainment

Monthly quota: $100K
Required pipeline: $300-400K

WHY: ~25-30% of pipeline typically closes

COVERAGE BY STAGE:
- Early stage (Qualified/Discovery): Count at 0.5x
- Mid stage (Demo/Proposal): Count at 1x
- Late stage (Negotiation): Count at 1.5x

WEIGHTED PIPELINE:
$100K in Discovery (20%) = $20K weighted
$100K in Proposal (60%) = $60K weighted
$50K in Negotiation (80%) = $40K weighted
Total weighted: $120K
```
