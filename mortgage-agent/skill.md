# Mortgage Agent - Loan Analysis & Lending Tools

## Mortgage Philosophy
```
"The best mortgage is the one that fits your financial goals, not just the lowest rate."

PRINCIPLES:
1. Understand the full cost of borrowing
2. Compare total loan cost, not just monthly payment
3. Know your debt-to-income limits
4. Shop rates from multiple lenders
5. Read every document before signing

## Qualification Calculations

### Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratios
```
FRONT-END RATIO (Housing):
Monthly Housing Payment / Gross Monthly Income
- Target: ≤28% (conventional)
- FHA allows up to 31%

BACK-END RATIO (Total Debt):
(Housing + All Monthly Debts) / Gross Monthly Income
- Target: ≤36-43% (conventional)
- FHA allows up to 43% (higher with compensating factors)
- VA has no front-end limit, 41% back-end guideline

EXAMPLE:
Gross Monthly Income: $8,000
Housing Payment: $2,000
Car Payment: $400
Student Loans: $300
Credit Cards (minimum): $100

Front-End: $2,000 / $8,000 = 25% ✓
Back-End: $2,800 / $8,000 = 35% ✓
```

### Maximum Loan Calculator
```markdown
## How Much Can You Afford?

### Income
- Gross Annual Income: $
- Gross Monthly Income: $ (annual ÷ 12)

### Current Debts (Monthly)
- Car payments: $
- Student loans: $
- Credit card minimums: $
- Other loans: $
- **Total Monthly Debt**: $

### DTI Calculation
- Max DTI: 43% (adjust for loan type)
- Max Total Payment: $ (income × 0.43)
- Available for Housing: $ (max - current debts)

### Estimated Max Purchase Price
| Down Payment | 3% | 5% | 10% | 20% |
|--------------|------|------|------|------|
| Max Loan | $ | $ | $ | $ |
| Max Price | $ | $ | $ | $ |

*Assumes 7% rate, 30-year term, includes taxes/insurance estimate*
```

### Quick Affordability Rules
```
28/36 RULE:
- Housing ≤28% of gross income
- Total debt ≤36% of gross income

3X INCOME RULE:
- Home price ≤3x annual income (conservative)
- Stretch to 4-5x with low debt, good rates

PAYMENT ESTIMATE:
- Roughly $6-7 per $1,000 borrowed (30-year at ~7%)
- $100,000 loan ≈ $650-700/month P&I
```

### Break-Even Analysis
- Points vs. No Points: X months
- 15yr vs. 30yr: $ savings, $ higher payment

### Recommendation
[Analysis and recommendation based on buyer's goals]
```

### APR vs Interest Rate
```
INTEREST RATE:
- Cost of borrowing (principal only)
- Used for monthly payment calculation

APR (Annual Percentage Rate):
- True cost of loan including fees
- Includes: Origination, points, PMI, etc.
- Use for comparing loan offers

EXAMPLE:
Loan A: 6.5% rate, 6.8% APR (high fees)
Loan B: 6.75% rate, 6.9% APR (low fees)

Short-term: Loan A may cost more (higher fees)
Long-term: Loan A saves money (lower rate)
```

### Points Analysis
```
1 POINT = 1% of loan amount

EXAMPLE:
$400,000 loan
1 point = $4,000

Rate without points: 7.0%
Rate with 1 point: 6.75%

Monthly savings: ~$65
Break-even: $4,000 / $65 = 62 months (5+ years)

BUY POINTS IF:
- You'll keep the loan 5+ years
- You have extra cash at closing
- You want to lower monthly payment

SKIP POINTS IF:
- You might refinance soon
- You might sell within 5 years
- You need cash for other uses
```

## Mortgage Formulas

### Monthly Payment Formula
```
M = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]

Where:
M = Monthly payment
P = Principal (loan amount)
r = Monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12)
n = Number of payments (years × 12)

EXAMPLE:
Loan: $300,000
Rate: 7% (0.07 annual, 0.00583 monthly)
Term: 30 years (360 payments)

M = 300,000 × [0.00583(1.00583)^360] / [(1.00583)^360 - 1]
M = $1,996/month (P&I)
```

### Amortization Schedule
```markdown
## Amortization: $300,000 at 7% for 30 years

| Year | Payment | Principal | Interest | Balance |
